d5k Landing Page
=================

This is a limited-functionality theme for WordPress designed to give you a beautiful, minimal landing page. It was created out of a necessity for my own [personal site](http://danhauk.com). The theme is built on a stripped-down version of [Underscores](http://underscores.me/).

## Functionality and customization

This landing page theme includes only limited functionality since it's not intended as a full site theme. Pages other than the landing page should render properly, but blog posts may be missing functions to make them work properly. There are also no navigation menus included.

Customizations:

* Custom background image
* Custom background color
* Choose a Gravatar
* Link a bunch of your social accounts
* Additional widgets

## Set up your landing page

First, upload the theme folder to your `/wp-content/themes` directory and activate it from the **Appearance > Themes** tab. Then:

1. **Create a new page.** The page title will be your greeting, the page content will be the content under the greeting. Make sure the "Landing Page" page template is selected.

2. **Add your social links.** In the widgets menu you'll find a custom widget called `Landing Page Social Links`. Add that to the Landing Page sidebar and link your social accounts.

3. **Customize.** From the customizer in the Appearance menu you can choose a custom background image or color, change text and link colors, and change from which email address your Gravatar is pulled. _Important: make sure your landing page that you created is selected as the static front page._
