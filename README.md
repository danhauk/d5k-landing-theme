d5k Landing Page
=================

This is a limited-functionality theme for WordPress designed to give you a beautiful, minimal landing page. It was created out of a necessity for my own [personal site](http://danhauk.com).

The theme is built on a stripped-down version of [Underscores](http://underscores.me/). It includes only limited functionality as it's not intended as a full site theme. Pages should render properly, but blog posts may be missing functions to make them work properly. Although that might be added later. Follow the directions below to set up your minimal landing page.

## How do I use this?

First, upload the theme folder to your `/wp-content/themes` directory and activate it from the **Appearance > Themes** tab. Then:

1. **Create a new page.** The page title will be your greeting, the page content will be the content under the greeting. Make sure the "Landing Page" page template is selected.

2. **Add your social links.** In the widgets menu you'll find a custom widget called `Landing Page Social Links`. Add that to the Landing Page sidebar and link your social accounts.

3. **Customize.** From the customizer in the Appearance menu you can choose a custom background image or color, change text and link colors, and change from which email address your Gravatar is pulled. _Important: make sure your landing page that you created is selected as the static front page._
